    <div class="col-12 padded padding-r padding-l">
        <p class="white-text" data-aos="fade-in">After attending the Florida Institute of Technology on a scholarship with the Men’s Soccer team, Dean went on
            to play professional and amateur soccer around the world. He has played in England, Australia, Trinidad and
            Tobago, Costa Rica, and Belgium. With his soccer career behind him, Dean was given the opportunity to delve
            into the world of American football, receiving another scholarship offer at the Florida Institute of
            Technology– this time to be the placekicker for the football team. However, in 2020 the pandemic began to
            cause worldwide disruption, and Dean’s plans to return to Florida were put on hold. With very little
            coaching resources available in England, Dean began to train himself on local rugby fields. Over the summer,
            the unprecedented uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic forced the Florida Tech Panthers to eliminate their
            football program. Despite this disappointment, Dean continued to learn and train, waiting for the next
            opportunity. </p>
        <p class="mt white-text" data-aos="fade-in">His perseverance paid off, and for the 2020 season, Dean was offered a scholarship at Colorado
            State University-Pueblo. He was the starting placekicker during his time at CSU Pueblo, and graduated in
            December 2021 with a Master’s degree in Business Administration. Following his graduation, Dean has now
            taken on the role of kicking coach at CSU Pueblo for the 2022 season, and will also assist with the team’s
            recruitment– pursuing and developing the best young kicking talent in Colorado and around the world.</p>
        <p class="mt white-text" data-aos="fade-in">Dean continues his daily training routine, awaiting an opportunity to kick at the professional level. He is
            committed to giving back to the sport, and has founded Gameday Kicking to provide an elite service to
            kickers in the US, UK, and around the world. He specializes in player mindset, development, and performance,
            and is passionate about providing a high-quality service for the next generation of kickers.</p>
